# A Simple Transformer Pipeline for Full-Key Side-Channel Attacks on Uncropped Datasets

- Project can be installed by cloning to some directory, creating environment with Python 3.11, and typing `pip install -e .`.
- `experiments` directory contains entrypoints and experiment-specific configuration/methods
  - `train_supervised_model.py` -- entrypoint for training models
  - `attribute_trained_model.py` -- entrypoint for doing feature attribution on trained models
  - `evaluate_trained_model.py` -- entrypoint for computing attack + localization performance of trained models or arbitrary attribution maps
  - `analysis_for_paper.py` -- entrypoint to generate figures in paper
- `src/leakage_localization` directory contains code designed to be reused
